gearshifft is an FFT library benchmark suite for cuFFT (CUDA, Nvidia GPUs), clFFT (OpenCL) and FFTW.
The benchmarks consist of a round-trip FFT, where each step is measured.
Written in C++14 most of the code layers are removed at compile-time to aim for minimal overhead.
The results are stored to a csv file for later processing.

Results and processing scripts can be found on: https://github.com/mpicbg-scicomp/gearshifft_results
